I've lived in this neighborhood since 2001. I raised my kids here and just love this neighborhood. This house is just a block from the neighborhood dock. Priced well below market because it's a cosmetic fixer upper and needs an A/C unit. The roof (dimensional) was replaced around three years ago. This house has a good amount of land in front and back. The dead end streets in Bay Crest make for less traffic. 8-11 minutes from Tampa international Airport, 15 minutes to downtown Tampa, 25 minutes to some of the best beaches. Convenient to all kinds of restaurants, shopping, theaters, etc. Won't you be my neighbor?	7800	Single Family Home | $159/sqft | Lot Size: 7,800 sqft | Built in 1961 | 71 Days on Trulia | Heating: Other | Cooling System: Central | Air Conditioning | Parking: Attached Garage | Garage | Parking Spaces: 1 | Exterior: Stucco | Roof: Composition | Year Updated: 1989 | Patio | MLS/Source ID: T3185986	Tampa	FL	3 Beds | 1 Bath | 1,255 sqft | Single Family Home | 7,800 sqft lot size | Built in 1961 | County: Hillsborough | Tax Rate Code Area: U | Heating: Yes | Parking: Garage | Parking Spaces: 1 | Stories: 1 story | Exterior: Stucco | Roof: Composition Shingle | Land Use Code: Single Family Residential | Subdivision Name: BAY CREST PARK UNIT NO 01 | UNINCORPORATED COUNTY	Single Family Home	5011 Shetland Ave Tampa, FL 33615	159	1255	199900	3	1	1961	33615	\N	0	\N	t

One enters this South-facing home through a spacious and welcoming entry/dining foyer, to the right of which is a sparkling updated kitchen with stainless steel Blomberg appliances, and abundant cabinetry fashioned in a crisp white and sleek gray above and below the rich marble counters, as well as a large, shelved pantry. The living room boasts decorative moldings, built-in shelving, and newly replaced, double-pained oversized windows overlooking protected townhouse gardens, historic landmarks, and notable midtown high-rises in the distance, together with abundant sky. There is beautiful hardwood flooring throughout. The bedroom connects through an "L" shaped hallway passage from the foyer, which has a wall of closets. There is more generous closet space with built-in shelving in the large master bedroom, which quite comfortably homes a king-sized bed. And the panoramic views from the bedroom compliment those of the living room, each respective wall of windows welcoming southern light all day long. The bath's recent renovation includes new fixtures and the addition of white subway tiling, which compliments the beautifully-maintained original tile flooring. 166 East 66th Street, between Park and Lexington Avenues, is situated on a leafy, architecturally distinguished block. At hand are Lexington Avenue's numerous long-treasured local shops, restaurants as diverse as Sel et Poivre, Boulud Sud, and Donoghue's, as well as high-end homeware and design stores such as William & Wayne and Smallbone. Equinox is three and a half blocks away, and the 4, 6, N, R, and W subways provide convenient access to the rest of the city. Renowned international luxury brands such as Hermès, Valentino and John Varvatos, as well as restaurants such as Sant Ambroeus, and discrete, elegant townhouse restaurants like JoHo, can be found in rich abundance along the Madison Avenue corridor nearby. Central Park is two and a half blocks away. This mid-rise, mid-block building has a full-time doorman attending its elegant lobby, a resident Superintendent, and a well-tended basement laundry. Apartment 7A itself has designated storage which transfers with sale, roughly the size of the apartment's bedroom closet.
