      'Situated on a generous 7,500 sqft lot surrounded by mature trees is this 1-story ranch where clean lines + muted neutrals rule. Recent renovations breathed new life into the interiors with a flow to the open floor plan that relishes in natural light from all corners. The living room stands front + center where gray wide plank hardwood begins and continues into the open dining room perched intentionally next to the spacious kitchen. The glimmering backsplash also clad in gray--a powerful neutral--complements the clean, white palette on the cabinets, slab stone countertops + surrounding walls. Stainless steel appliances shimmer from the daylight working in tandem w/ recessed lighting throughout. Off the open floor plan is the 2nd bedroom w/ ample closet space + gray hardwood floors. Sleek simplicity defines the secluded master suite with soft carpet, closets + connected bath where stunning tile work stars in the shower. Perched in Mar Lee w/ a 2 car garage, this ranch is a dreamy setting.',

      "FILM-CALIBER VIEWS, and *utilities covered in the maintenance* are just two reasons to love this recently renovated and spacious 1 bedroom, 1 bath apartment on East 66th Street between Park and Lexington avenues. One enters this South-facing home through a spacious and welcoming entry/dining foyer, to the right of which is a sparkling updated kitchen with stainless steel Blomberg appliances, and abundant cabinetry fashioned in a crisp white and sleek gray above and below the rich marble counters, as well as a large, shelved pantry. The living room boasts decorative moldings, built-in shelving, and newly replaced, double-pained oversized windows overlooking protected townhouse gardens, historic landmarks, and notable midtown high-rises in the distance, together with abundant sky. There is beautiful hardwood flooring throughout. The bedroom connects through an \"L\" shaped hallway passage from the foyer, which has a wall of closets. There is more generous closet space with built-in shelving in the large master bedroom, which quite comfortably homes a king-sized bed. And the panoramic views from the bedroom compliment those of the living room, each respective wall of windows welcoming southern light all day long. The bath's recent renovation includes new fixtures and the addition of white subway tiling, which compliments the beautifully-maintained original tile flooring. 166 East 66th Street, between Park and Lexington Avenues, is situated on a leafy, architecturally distinguished block. At hand are Lexington Avenue's numerous long-treasured local shops, restaurants as diverse as Sel et Poivre, Boulud Sud, and Donoghue's, as well as high-end homeware and design stores such as William & Wayne and Smallbone. Equinox is three and a half blocks away, and the 4, 6, N, R, and W subways provide convenient access to the rest of the city. Renowned international luxury brands such as Hermès, Valentino and John Varvatos, as well as restaurants such as Sant Ambroeus, and discrete, elegant townhouse restaurants like JoHo, can be found in rich abundance along the Madison Avenue corridor nearby. Central Park is two and a half blocks away. This mid-rise, mid-block building has a full-time doorman attending its elegant lobby, a resident Superintendent, and a well-tended basement laundry. Apartment 7A itself has designated storage which transfers with sale, roughly the size of the apartment's bedroom closet. Pieds-à-terre and trust purchases, as well as 50% financing are permitted, however subletting is discouraged. There are no assessments, current or planned, and the seller pays the building's 2% flip tax. Weekend open houses are not permitted, but weekend appointments can be accommodated. Pets are welcome.",

      'Amazing opportunity in Twin Branch Acres. Beautiful, private and spacious home located on a cul-de-sac on one of the prettiest streets in TBA. The home features an open and specious floor plan. Four bedrooms and three full bathrooms together with a swimming pool and two car garage. Slightly above one acre, this beautiful lot is large enough to provide privacy yet small enough to easily manage. The entire lot is fenced so bring the family, horses and dogs...plenty of room for everyone. An exterior stable/building compliment this house as well. Throughout the years, this home has received many upgrades, most recently the kitchen was beautifully redone. Why pay the high prices and fees of Westchase/Waterchase when you can live at TBA While the home may feel like you are in the country, you are within close proximity to shopping, TIA and Pinellas county. Thank you for considering this home.',

      'With 3 acres in the city of Richmond, Windemere is a spectacular and dramatic property while simultaneously being one of warmth and charm. Originally built as a hunting lodge, this 4-story English Estate sits back from Cary Street Road with its green lawns, circular driveway and Charles Gillette formal garden. This 10,000+ square foot home offers the most prepossessing entrance hall with its beamed ceiling, grand staircase, and original oak paneling, now painted a welcoming soft white. The delightful "hidden" guest bath off the foyer is a joy to see. Arched doorways lead to the light-filled living areas and dining room. The sun room with continuous 12-paned windows overlooks the back-terrace and lawn. The kitchen has custom-designed cabinetry, granite counter tops, and a double sided fireplace. The guest apartment with its own staircase has a living area, kitchenette, bedroom and adjoining full bath. The lower level includes a recreation room or media room, full bath, sauna, laundry area, wine cellar and access to the climate controlled 4 car garage (each bay is 2 cars deep). This unique property is completed with an elevator, pool and amazing outdoor patio space.',
